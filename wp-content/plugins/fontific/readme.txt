Fontific allows you to use Google Fonts on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Fontific gives you a really simple way to use fonts from [Google Web Font library](http://www.google.com/webfonts "Google Web Font library") on your Wordpress-powered website. 

To use one of those fantastic fonts, you just need to add a new font rule in Fontific panel(Appearance/Fonts admin menu), specify css selector to which this rule will be applied, setup font settings and save changes you've made. That's it.

* No need to edit any css stylesheets
* No new database tables are created
* Friendly UI (use sliders to adjust font size or line height)

**Translations**

* English
* German (Till Grzegorczyk)
* Polish (Piotr Dąbrowski)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Some Google fonts are missing in plugin =

New fonts added to Google Font Library are not automatically added to plugin font list. But there is a way to manually add new font you want to use immediately. To do this:

1) Create "fonts.txt" file in plugin root directory(where fontific.php is)

2) Copy font names from Google font directory(ex. Swanky and Moo Moo)

3) Add new font names to fonts.txt — each font on a separate line
